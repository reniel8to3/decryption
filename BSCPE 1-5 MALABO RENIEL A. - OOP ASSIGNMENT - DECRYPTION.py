#Write a Python Script that will accept a string as encrypted text and then the program will decrypt it using the following character substitute:'a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !
print("\033[1;35m This program is made to decrypt messages that substitutes the characters '*' as 'a', '&' as 'e', '#' as 'i', '+' as 'o', and '!' as 'u'.")
#ask user what they want to decrypt
#set conversion value for a
#set conversion value for e
#set conversion value for i
#set conversion value for o
#set conversion value for u
